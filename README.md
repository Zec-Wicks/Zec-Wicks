# Zechariah Wicks

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Zechariah Wicks, a cyber researcher at Defence Science Technology Group and a student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (Software) (Honours) and a Bachelor of Information Technology (Honours) at Flinders University.

## About Me

I'm passionate about more than just Computer Science (although, I do have a keen interest in data analysis and machine learning). In my free time, you might find me hiking ‚õ∞Ô∏è, knitting üß∂, or playing games.

I have been the [GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/Zec-Wicks/) üö© for [Flinders Unviersity](https://flinders.edu.au), and Adelaide since 2023.

Some of my favourite programming languages are Java and C++ for their versatility, but Python has quickly been becomming one of my favourites for how easy it is to use. In the future, I want to learn Rust and Julia!
